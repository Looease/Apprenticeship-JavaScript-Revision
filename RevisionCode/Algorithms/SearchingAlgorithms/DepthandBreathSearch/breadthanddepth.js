//Pseudo Code for depth search
//push the root node onto a stack
//while (stack is not empty)
//pop a node off the stack
//check this node to see if it matches your search (if so, stop!)
//push all the children of this node onto the stack

//Breadth and depth search take the same amount of time. 
//Relevant when you don't have data you can compare.
//if your tree is wide but shallow, depth-first will use less memory; if it's deep but narrow, breadth-first will be better.
